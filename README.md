This is a reproduction of the Nintendo Switch console and its main menu in a minimalistic visual style with CSS.

The controllers can be customized by chaging their colors to all possible colors used by real Nintendo Switch controllers.

There's even an include mini-game, in which you need to press the button as soon as possible after you hear a noise. See how fast your reflexes are!
